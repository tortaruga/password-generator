### overview
Random password generator, made as coding practice. 

#### personalization
You can choose the length of your password, and whether you'd like to include numbers or special symbols. 
If length settings are left blank, the password generated will have a length between 12 and 16 characters.

#### password strength
The password strength is calculated according to 4 criteria: password length, numbers, special characters, and repetitions.
A strong password has to satify all the criteria:
- have a length between 12 and 16 characters
- include at least a number
- include at least one special character
- have no characters repeating consecutively (es. "aa", "44").
